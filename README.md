# PMT AdBlocker Extension

A simple chrome extension that blocks adverts on PMT's PDF viewer. PMT likes to put a sidebar of adverts on their PDFs, with videos that half the time aren't even targeted - GCSE Chemistry on an A-Level Further Maths paper? Doesn't make sense. This extension removes the ads and the sidebar, so you can enjoy the PDFs in full size!

This extension works without any seperate adblocker aswell!
Just install PMTAdBlocker and enjoy PMT PDFs without them being squashed by the adverts.
